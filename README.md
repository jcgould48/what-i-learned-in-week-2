# What I learned in week 2

 
Week two was mostly about coding with CSS in order to style our webpages.

Some of the main tools we use were:
* Riple.it
* CSS Diner
* VSC extensions to assist with organization

### CSS
This type of coding is primarily used to enhance the design of a webpage.

1. One of our first exercises to learn about CSS was to create a web page that was as ugly as possible.

For this, we were given a skeleton and told to manipulate some of the features.

2. The next exercise was to copy a page that Colin had made which included a search bar and button, a horizontal menu bar, and a table.  This was a bit more challenging as we had to really focus on making our code to accurately reflect the exercise.

3.  Another exercise was to exactly cope a legitimate web page as close as possible.  I chose Google, as I thought there would be a lot about it if I needed help.

4.  Finally were looked at dev controls to change the style of an active webpage in real time.
