# What I learned in week 2

 
Week two was mostly about coding with CSS in order to style our webpages.

Some of the main tools we use were:
* Riple.it
* CSS Diner
* VSC extensions to assist with organization

### CSS
This type of coding is primarily used to enhance the design of a webpage.

1. One of our first exercises to learn about CSS was to create a web page that was as ugly as possible.

For this, we were given a skeleton and told to manipulate some of the features.

2. The next exercise was to copy a page that Colin had made which included a search bar and button, a horizontal menu bar, and a table.  This was a bit more challenging as we had to really focus on making our code to accurately reflect the exercise.

3.  Another exercise was to exactly cope a legitimate web page as close as possible.  I chose Google, as I thought there would be a lot about it if I needed help.

4.  Finally were looked at dev controls to change the style of an active webpage in real time.

### Other Activities
We also continued to work on logic problems as well as Human Resource Machine. As well as working on activities to improve our understanding of the box model

### Java Script

We also got our introduction to JS.  Some of the main points were to only use let and const and never var.

We also did some initial exercises to see what the code looks like.

### Conclusion
I feel more confident with CSS but there is still a lot of work ahead.

My main issues are:
* Knowing the various commands
* Understanding layout and boxes
* Changing the precise code I intend
